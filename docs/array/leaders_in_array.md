- Leader in an array is the element that there is no larger than the element to its right side.
- Left most is always be leader because there is no large then that element to its right side.
- If there are duplicate elements then first occurance can be considers as leader. We can consider last occurance because we are say larger but not equal.
    - Ex: {9, 11, 6, 11, 8, 7, 2} <br>
    :: here can not consider 11 of 1st index. we can condier 11 of 3rd index.
